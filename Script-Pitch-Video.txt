[NOW segment – Introduction]
Hello, I am Aïtor Olivos, and I’m currently a first-year engineering student in Computer Science at ENSEEIHT.
I’ve just started this part of my life, yet I’m already getting involved in student life.
Indeed, I’m following the training for N7 Consulting, our Junior Enterprise.
The training within HR and Quality divisions allows me to discover what engineering projects look like.

[PAST segment – Academic background]
Before coming to N7, I studied at CPGE Lycée Thiers in Marseille.
That path was very theoretical — focused on mathematics, physics, and computer science — and it taught me how to think rigorously and solve complex problems.
Before that, I completed my Baccalauréat in Mathematics and Computer Science with distinction at Lycée Albert Calmette.

Even earlier, I earned my Brevet d’Initiation Aéronautique, because I’ve always been fascinated by technology, systems, and how things work together — whether in software or in the skies.

[FUTURE segment – Goals & alignment]
At N7, I’m planning to specialize in Software Systems in my second year, and then in Embedded and Critical IoT Systems in my third year.
However, as an active member of UNIVERSEH, I know that new masters linked with Erasmus Mundus are coming.
Hence, I wish to pursue a double degree through Erasmus Mundus with UNIVERSEH instead of the third-year specilisation.
Indeed, it would be an incredible academic and cultural experience.

[Mobility projects]
International experience is something I value a lot. I’ve already identified three mobility projects I’d like to pursue:

First, a linguistic stay in Taiwan, followed by an internship there, to immerse myself in a completely different culture and strengthen my adaptability.

Then, a semester at a UNIVERSEH university during my gab year, to discover new perspectives on software systems and sustainable innovation.

Finally, the Erasmus Mundus double degree within UNIVERSEH, spending two semesters in European universities before returning to N7 — an amazing way to build both technical and intercultural skills.

[Role models & inspiration]
Throughout my reflections on MyJobGlasses, I’ve also identified three professionals who really inspire me:

Carole, a project engineer. I want to meet her to learn more about this ability to coordinate people thanks to communication and leadership.

Katy, a staffing manager, who inspired me with her perspective on how to match people’s strengths with the right projects 
-- On le coupe : — something I want to learn from.

And Eulaly, a quality assurance manager whose role deeply interests me — because ensuring quality is something I’d love to take responsibility for one day.

[Closing – Enthusiasm & flow]
In the short term, I want to gain hands-on experience through projects with N7 Consulting.
In the mid-term, I’d like to work as a project engineer.
And in the long run, I see myself combining my passion for software systems with leadership and quality management.

-- Pas de temps pour ça
N7 is the perfect place to build this path — through its strong technical program, its connections with UNIVERSEH, and its professional ecosystem.
